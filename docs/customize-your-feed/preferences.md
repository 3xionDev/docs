The preferences options enable you to fine-tune your user experiences of daily.dev by toggling some options on/off. Currently, the available options are:

- Show reading streaks
- Open links in new tab
- Show custom shortcuts
- Show feed sorting menu
- Enable companion

As Accessibility:
- Automatically dismiss notifications

## Show reading streaks

By default, daily.dev displays your reading streaks on the top right corner of your feed. If you want to hide your reading streaks, then set the `Show reading streaks` toggle switch to `off`.

## Open link in new tab

By default, when you click on a post link on your feed (using the `Read post` button on the post), daily.dev will open that post in a new tab. However, if you want daily.dev to open that post in the current tab, then set the `Open links in new tab` toggle switch to `off`.

## Show custom shortcuts

By enabling this option, you will have access to custom shortcuts at the top middle of your feed

## Show feed sorting menu

Turning this toggle switch on will add a dropdown menu to My feed and Popular feed, enabling you to sort these feeds `By date` or by `Recommended` as seen in the image below:

## Enable companion

Turning this toggle switch `on` will activate the [companion widget](https://docs.daily.dev/docs/key-features/the-companion), and turning this toggle switch `off` will deactivate the companion widget.

The companion widget is a game changer as it enhances your user experiences by letting you bookmark, comment, and upvote directly on the original post. And to activate this widget, click on the companion button on the top right corner of the daily.dev menu bar as seen below:

Then click on the `Activate companion` button in the description box as seen below:

After this, it will ask you to grant it extra permission so that the companion widget can be displayed directly on the original post.
