:::info
In our ongoing effort to maintain a balanced content inventory on the platform, we are temporarily giving higher priority to niche sources during our review process. This allows us to provide our developer community with a diverse range of topics and unique perspectives. As a result, we may apply more strict judgment on new source suggestions that feature mainstream content. This is to ensure that our platform maintains a healthy mix of content and caters to various interests within the developer community.

### When will we reject a source suggestion?

:::caution
Please note that we kindly ask you not to share copyrighted or trademarked sources. If you did not create the source you are submitting for review, make sure it's publicly accessible for sharing. We will give due credit to the owner.

### Additional guidelines for personal blogs

At the moment, the basic rule of thumb in our review process is that we do not approve personal blogs. However, we recently started working gradually towards allowing personal blogs on the platform. During this interim period, we will only approve personal blogs that meet specific criteria. If you're submitting a personal blog for review, please ensure it meets the following guidelines:

✅ Personal blog of a global thought leader who has a significant impact on the developer community.

✅ Focused on niche topics that cater to specific and non-mainstream interests.

Please note that these additional guidelines for personal blogs are subject to change as we continue to refine our review process.

## Be respectful to the community

The daily.dev community is highly sensitive to content quality and the code of conduct of publishers. After a new source is approved and added to the daily.dev feed, we continue to monitor it continuously. Our aim is simple -- to maintain and enforce the content guidelines for the benefit of our community.

‍We kindly ask you to refrain from misusing the opportunity to be listed on the daily.dev feed.
