# How to suggest a new source

## Introduction

At daily.dev, we collect articles from over 400 unique sources across the web. All of our sources have been added following a request we got from the community. That's an essential part of our community-driven approach. 

We try our best to cover as much quality content as possible. But sometimes, it happens that you like to follow a particular source that's not in our current sources list. We understand that. That's why we have the option to request new sources! 

Learn more about [how does daily.dev work](../how-does-daily-dev-work/dailydev-101.md). 

## How to submit a new source request?

We've tried to make this process as simple as possible. 

### Prerequisites

1. Please read our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md) carefully and **make sure your publication meets the criteria**. 
2. **Create an account** on daily.dev
3. Make sure your publication has a **public RSS feed**

:::tip
If you're running a company blog that has both promotional articles and technical articles, we highly recommend to separate the technical articles to a dedicated RSS feed.

### Submitting your source

1. Go to your feed, either in the [browser extension](../getting-started/browser-extension-installation.md) or in the [web app](https://app.daily.dev)
2. Click on the left sidebar to open it
3. Choose the "Suggest new source" option 
4. Insest a URL of your publication's RSS feed (recommended) or a URL to your publication's homepage
5. Click the Submit button and you're good to go

### Review process

Once you've successfully submitted a source request our team would manually review it. That's our way to ensure that the [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md) are met. The review process usually takes between 7-21 days.

You can expect to receive the following notifications by email:
1. Once the source request was successfully sent
2. Once your source request got approved or rejected
3. If our team would have a question, they will reach you out directly via email

## FAQ

### What happens after my source was approved?

Once it was approved, every new post that will be published under this source will be collected by the daily.dev feed. It might take a few days until it fully synced, so keep that in mind.

### My source request got rejected, Can I submit it again?

Basically, yes. But please be mindful and only submit your source again once you've made a substantial change. If you got rejected and you'd like to get additional information please contact us at support@daily.dev

### Where can I see the status of my review process?

Besides the email notifications, there's no way to check the status of your source request review process. Your patience is much appreciated :)
