# How to suggest a new source

## Introduction

At daily.dev, we collect posts from over 400 unique sources across the web. All of our sources have been added following a request we got from the community. That's an essential part of our community-driven approach. 

We try our best to cover as much quality content as possible. But sometimes, it happens that you like to follow a particular source that's not in our current sources list. We understand that. That's why we have the option to request new sources!

We've tried to make this process as simple as possible. 

### Prerequisites

1. Please read our [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md) carefully and ensure your publication meets the criteria. 
2. Register to daily.dev
3. Create a [personal feed](../key-features/feeds.md) using the sidebar
4. Make sure your publication has a public RSS feed

:::tip
If you're running a company blog with both promotional and technical posts, we highly recommend separating the technical posts to a dedicated RSS feed.

### Submitting your source

1. Go to your feed, either in the [browser extension](../getting-started/browser-extension-installation.md) or in the [web app](https://app.daily.dev)
2. [Create a personal feed](../key-features/feeds.md). If you already have one, skip this step
3. Click on the feed filters icon (see screenshot below)
4. Choose the `Suggest new source` option 
5. Insert a URL of your publication's RSS feed (recommended) or a URL to your publication's homepage
6. Click the `Submit` button, and you're good to go

### Review process

Once you've successfully submitted a source request our team would manually review it. That's our way to ensure that the [content guidelines](/for-content-creators/content-guidelines.md) are met. The review process usually takes between 7-21 days.

You can expect to receive the following notifications by email:
1. Once the source request was successfully sent
2. Once your source request got approved or rejected
3. If our team would have a question, they will reach you out directly via email

## FAQ

### What happens after my source was approved?

If it gets approved, every new post that is published by this source will be collected by daily.dev, analysed, and if it is suitable will be added to the feed. It might take a few days until it is fully synced, so please bear that in mind.

### My source request got rejected, Can I submit it again?

Basically, yes. But please be mindful and only submit your source again once you've made a substantial change. If you got rejected and you'd like to get additional information please contact us at support@daily.dev

### Where can I see the status of my review process?

Besides the email notifications, there's no way to check the status of your source request review process. Your patience is much appreciated :)
