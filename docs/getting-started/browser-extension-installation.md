### My Chrome's bookmarks bar is gone. How can I bring it back?

It's quite simple. All you need is to enable the `Show Bookmarks Bar` option in your browser. There are two ways mentioned below to display the bookmarks bar in Google Chrome:

* Using Keyboard Shortcuts
* Using Chrome's Settings Menu

#### Using Keyboard Shortcuts

Below are the shortcut keys that you can use to toggle bookmark toolbar:

For Windows users: CTRL+SHIFT+B

For Mac users: CMD⌘+SHIFT⇧+B

#### Using Chrome's Settings Menu

Click on the three dots (⠇) on the top right corner of your Google Chrome browser. Go to Bookmarks > Show Bookmarks Bar.

### Showing shortcuts to Chrome's most visited sites

To add shortcuts of the most visited site to daily.dev, click on the `Show most visited sites` button:
