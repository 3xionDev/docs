## What is reputation?

**Reputation is a rough measurement of how much the community trusts you.** it is earned by getting positive feedback (as upvotes) from other community members on comments you post and articles you write that got picked up by our feed. 

The more reputation you earn, the more privileges you will gain, and the more tools you'll have access to on daily.dev. That is intentional. We don’t run this site; the community does! Although specific privileges are not announced yet, we encourage you to start building your reputation on the platform, as your points are **publicly visible on your profile.** 

## How do I earn reputation points?

The primary way to earn reputation is by posting useful comments. However, there are some other ways you can earn more reputation:

You earn reputation when:
* Your comment is voted up: +1
* Your comment gets featured: +2
* An article you wrote is voted up: +1
