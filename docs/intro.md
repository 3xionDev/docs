# Introduction

## WE ARE DEVELOPERS LIKE YOU

### Staying up to date takes a lot of time and effort.
‚Äç
It's essential for every developer, yet it's not a simple thing at all! Why?
1. There are so many publications.
2. Low-quality content is all around.
3.  The tech world is rapidly changing.

That's what made us build daily.dev.

### Our mission is to build the home page that every developer deserves.

We believe that together we can empower better software. We are 100% open-source and we welcome everyone to contribute and take part in our journey.
