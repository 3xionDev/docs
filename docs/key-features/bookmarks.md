# Bookmarks

## Why are bookmarks important

Staying up to date can also be done async. So, you've seen an interesting article and want to read it later? That's where bookmarks come into play.

Saving bookmarks is pretty straightforward in daily.dev. Let's learn how it works.

## How to save an article in the bookmarks?

To bookmark an article, click on the bookmark icon on the article. When you click it, it turns orange, indicating it has been bookmarked. Clicking on it again will remove the bookmark. 

Similarly, you can remove bookmarks from the bookmarks section (see below).

## How to show all the bookmarks?

Use the toggle button at the header of daily.dev to toggle between your feed and bookmarks.
