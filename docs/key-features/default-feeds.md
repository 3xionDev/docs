# Feeds

There are four feeds on daily.dev, and each feed has its own ranking logic:

1. My feed (beta)
2. Popular feed 
3. Most upvoted feed
4. Best discussions feed

## My feed

:::note
My feed is currently in beta. Once the beta period ends, we will open it up to everyone!

### Creating my feed for the first time
If you are new to daily.dev then you might want to know that the first thing we strongly recommend is filtering your feed. That way, you should get relevant content that would help you stay updated. Click on Create my feed and then [follow this guide](../settingyourfeed/filtering-content-feed.md).

### Configuring my feed

:::info
Wondering where your feed filters are? No worries, we simply relocated them to `My feed` instead of the `Popular feed` where they used to be up until now. Your feed settings and filters remain the same as you had in previous versions. 
:::

To apply and change your feed settings on your feed, click the feed filters button:

## Popular feed 

**Most popular** articles a listed first.

One of the things we're proud of the most, is that we do not do any manual ranking or curation. Everything is automatic. How come? Once an article is being [picked up by daily.dev](../how-does-daily-dev-work/how-to-get-featured.md), it starts to rank. The ranking is determined by several factors, including:

* The unique number of times this article was read
* The number of upvotes this post got from our community members
* The freshness of the article (e.g., when as it published)
* Other parameters related to the content-quality and engagement levels. Those other parameters aren't playing a major role in the ranking.

That way, we can increase the probability that interesting and valuable posts will surface up the feed. However, the ranking system isn't perfect, and we constantly fine-tune it to achieve the optimal results for our readers.

### Sort by date (prev. Recent feed)

:::note
**The Recent feed is no longer available since v3.11.0.** The good news is that we’re going to introduce a new option to sort your feeds by date! We will open up an new setting to add a sorting option through the `Customize` menu on the sidebar. We will start building it soon, so stay tuned on our [changelog](https://changelog.daily.dev) ⚡️
:::

## Most upvoted feed

**Most upvoted** articles are listed first.

In the Upvoted Feed, we feature the most upvoted articles currently on the platform. The ranking in this feed works by the number of upvotes. The higher the upvote count is, the higher the article will be listed in the feed.

:::tip
The default view is the most upvoted posts of the last 7 days. However, you can choose to filter it to a different time frame such as "Last Month" or "Last Year".
:::

## Best discussions feed

The articles with the **best discussions** are listed first.

In the Discussed Feed, we offer the most interesting discussions currently on the platform. The ranking is determined by multiple factors like the reputation levels of the people who commented, the freshness of the comments, the number of upvotes on the comments, and more.
