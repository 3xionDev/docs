## Popular Feed 

**Most popular** articles a listed first.

One of the things we're proud of the most, is that we do not do any manual ranking or curation. Everything is automatic. How come? Once an article is being [picked up by daily.dev](../how-does-daily-dev-work/how-to-get-featured.md), it starts to rank. The ranking is determined by several factors, including:

* The unique number of times this article was read
* The number of upvotes this post got from our community members
* The freshness of the article (e.g., when as it published)
* Other parameters related to the content-quality and engagement levels. Those other parameters aren't playing a major role in the ranking.

That way, we can increase the probability that interesting and valuable posts will surface up the feed. However, the ranking system isn't perfect, and we constantly fine-tune it to achieve the optimal results for our readers.

> ðŸ’¡ *Pro tip:* *Check out the latest release note about [Feed v2.0](https://app.daily.dev/posts/Pua7g-36i).*

## Upvoted

**Most upvoted** articles are listed first.

In the Upvoted Feed, we feature the most upvoted articles currently on the platform. The ranking in this feed works by the number of upvotes. The higher the upvote count is, the higher the article will be listed in the feed.

> ðŸ’¡ *Pro tip:* The default view is the most upvoted posts of the last 7 days. However, you can choose to filter it to a different time frame such as "Last Month" or "Last Year".

## Discussed

The articles with the **best discussions** are listed first.

In the Discussed Feed, we offer the most interesting discussions currently on the platform. The ranking is determined by multiple factors like the reputation levels of the people who commented, the freshness of the comments, the number of upvotes on the comments, and more.

## Recent

**Most recent** articles are listed first.

The name probably speaks for itself. The Recent Feed is the most simple one in our stack. It is stored by date. In the Recent Feed, you'll be able to see the most recent articles that got picked up by daily.dev.
