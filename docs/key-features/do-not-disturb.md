# Do not disturb

Content consumption can be distracting at times. Whenever you open a new tab, see some exciting recent news, you start reading it. We understand your concern. That's why we have built a DND feature.

Choose this option if you want to disable the extension temporarily.

## Do Not Disturb Mode 

Snooze, or as we call it, Do Not Disturb mode allows you to turn off daily.dev for a while. Currently, there are five options available for you to snooze daily.dev:
* 30 minutes
* 1 hour
* 2 hours
* Until tomorrow
* Custom (lets you set the exact amount of time you want to be in DND)

### Configuring an alternative default new tab (optional)

Once you enter Do Not Disturb, you will be redirected to a default URL every time you open a new tab. In most browsers, the default is Google search. 

However, you can select a different URL used as your new tab while you're on Do Not Disturb.
