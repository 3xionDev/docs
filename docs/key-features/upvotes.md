# Upvotes

## What is an upvote? 

Upvote is a standard method used by many community-driven products which allow users to signal their approval or support for a post. 

Upvotes usually help move a post towards the top of the feed, and they are a way to measure how many people approve of the content in a post.

Upvotes are a great way to support articles and to show your appreciation for the work of the authors. 

If you read an article and find it helpful, we highly encourage you to upvote it. 

Upvoting is important for several reasons:
- It helps our feed algorithm understand that the community approves of this post, helping us show the most interesting articles to our community.
* It gives recognition to content creators for the hard work they put in to creating content.
* It signals other community members that a particular post is interesting, thus saving them time and effort finding interesting and engaging articles to read.
