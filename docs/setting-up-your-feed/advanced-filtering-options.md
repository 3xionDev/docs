# Advanced filtering

In this guide, you will learn how to fine-tune your feed based on **content categories**.

## What are the advanced filtering options?

 The primary filtering mechanism on daily.dev is [based on tags](/docs/setting-up-your-feed/filtering-content-feed), but sometimes it's not enough. 
 
 Some posts may contain a tag you follow, yet it is not quite what you're looking for. 
 
 Configuring your feed based on content categories might help as **content categories are treated separately to the tags you follow**.

###  Configuring content categories

Click on the "My Feed" filter button (1) to open the feed options menu.

Then choose "Advanced" from the feed filters menu (2). 

Once done, you should be able to see the following menu:

Once on the Advanced menu, you get several on/off toggle switches to control the type of content you would like to see in your feed. Use the toggle switches to select your preferred options:

| Community Picks (3)       | [Community Picks](/docs/key-features/community-picks) are individual articles that are sourced by daily.dev community members. They are normally high quality and or highly entertaining articles that the community feels are valuable.    |
| Newsletters (4)           | Show posts that were published in developer newsletters. Such posts usually contain curated lists and opinionated essays.                                                                                                                      |
| Non-editorial content (5) | Show user-generated posts that were created on blogging platforms that are not editor dirven. Such posts may not be checked professional editors for factual accuracy, spelling, grammar etc.                                                  |
| Product launches (6)      | Show posts that aim to help you discover new product launches or significant releases to existing developer tools.                                                                                                                             |
| Showcases (7)             | Show posts that aim to showcase a project or contain predominently code snippets. These posts usually provide a demo-only of the showcased work without broader context around it.                                                             |
| Tech magazines (8)        | Show tech news posts not directly related to programming but still focused on tech. For example, reports about tech companies, startups, venture capital, and scientific discoveries.                                                          |
