# Advanced filtering

## What are the advanced filtering options?

In this guide, you will learn how to fine-tune your feed based on **content categories**. The primary filtering mechanism on daily.dev is [based on tags](/settingyourfeed/filtering-content-feed.md), but sometimes it's not enough. Some posts might contain a tag you follow, yet they are not quite what you're looking for. Configuring your feed based on content categories might help in this case since **content categories are agnostic to the tags you follow**.

###  Navigate to the Advanced menu

The first step would be to open the sidebar by clicking on the ⚙️ icon -> Choose "Advanced" 

Once done, you should be able to see the following menu:

### Configure content categories

Once on the Advanced menu, you get several on/off toggle switches to control the type of content you would like to see in your feed. Use the toggle switches to select your preferred options:

### Available content categories


| Category                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |
| Tech magazines            | Show tech news posts unrelated directly to programming, for example, reports about tech companies, startups, venture capital, and scientific discoveries.                              |
| Non-editorial content     | Show user-generated posts that were created on external blogging platforms. Such posts are usually not checked by professional editors for factual accuracy, spelling, grammar, and punctuation.    |
| Showcases                 | Show posts that aim to showcase a project or other types of code snippets. These posts usually provide a demo-only of the showcased work without broader context around it.                       |
| Newsletters               | Show posts that were published in developer newsletters. Such posts usually contain curated lists and opinionated essays.                                                                         |
| Product launches          | Show posts that aim to help you discover new product launches or significant releases to existing developer tools.                                                                                          |

## How to filter specific sources?

We do acknowledge that the option to filter sources isn't directly supported anymore. The current filtering experience is focused mainly on topics (tags). 

Since we aim to bring the most relevant content, regardless of where it was published, we decided to focus our filtering options based on tags. We hope this will simplify the filtering experience for our community.

Anyway, we listed down a bunch of alternative solutions:

If you want to read content from a specific source, you have the following options:

1. Clicking on the source's icon (on the post's card) will lead you to a feed of that specific source. If you're using the web app, you can save the link in your browser's bookmarks bar to easily access it later.
2. If you can't find content from the source you're looking for, try to search it and then go back to option one above.
3. Use an external RSS reader to curate only the sources you like.

If you want to filter out a specific source, please check out this [guide](/settingyourfeed/blocking-tags-sources.md).
