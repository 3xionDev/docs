# Advanced filtering

## What are the advanced filtering options?

In this guide, you will learn how to fine-tune your feed based on **content categories**. The primary filtering mechanism on daily.dev is [based on tags](/settingyourfeed/filtering-content-feed.md), but sometimes it's not enough. Some posts might contain a tag you follow, yet they are not quite what you're looking for. Configuring your feed based on content categories might help in this case since **content categories are agnostic to the tags you follow**.

###  Navigate to the Advanced menu

The first step would be to open the sidebar by clicking on the ⚙️ icon -> Choose "Advanced" 

Once done, you should be able to see the following menu:

### Configure content categories

Once on the Advanced menu, you get several on/off toggle switches to control the type of content you would like to see in your feed. Use the toggle switches to select your preferred options:

### Available content categories


| Category                  | Description                                                                                                                                                                                           |
|-----------------------    |----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------   |
| Tech magazines            | Show tech news posts unrelated directly to programming, for example, reports about tech companies, startups, venture capital, and scientific discoveries.                              |
| Non-editorial content     | Show user-generated posts that we're created on external blogging platforms. Such posts are usually not checked by professional editors for factual accuracy, spelling, grammar, and punctuation.    |
| Showcases                 | Show posts that aim to showcase a project or other types of code snippets. These posts usually provide a demo-only of the showcased work without broader context around it.                       |
| Newsletters               | Show posts that were published in developer newsletters. Such posts usually contain curated lists and opinionated essays.                                                                         |
| Product launches          | Show posts that aim to help you discover new product launches or significant releases to existing developer tools.                                                                                          |
