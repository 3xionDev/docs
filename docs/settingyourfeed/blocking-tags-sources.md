# Blocking tags and sources

## How does blocking works?

Adjusting your feed is designed to be straightforward. But sometimes, there are specific tags or sources that you just don't want to see at all. This is where blocking plays an important role. 

Blocking allows you to:
1. Remove all articles that contain a **specific tag**
2. Remove all articles that come from a **specific source**

### Blocking tags

Tags can have the following states:
* Following / Not following
* Blocked 

| Tag A (State)     | Tag B (State)     | Will you see the article?     |
|---------------    |---------------    |---------------------------    |
| Following         | Following         | ✅ Yes                         |
| Following         | Not following     | ✅ Yes                         |
| Not following     | Not following     | ❌ No                          |
| Not following     | Blocked           | ❌ No                          |
| Following         | Blocked           | ❌ No                          |

### Blocking sources

A source can have the following states:
* Following (default for all sources)
* Blocked 

| Source (State)    | Will you see the article?     |
|----------------   |---------------------------    |
| Following         | ✅ Yes                         |
| Blocked           | ❌ No                          |

Blocking tags and sources can be done directly from the feed. Whenever you see a post with a tag/source you wish to block, click on the more options button (⋮) 
* To block a tag -> Choose “Not interested in #tag_name“
* To block a source -> Choose "Don't show articles from #source_name "

Once clicked, the blocked tags and sources will be removed from your feed.

> 💡 *Pro tip:* if you can't find an article from a specific tag or source you wish to block, try using the [search feature](../key-features/search.md).
