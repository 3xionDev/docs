# Filtering content

## Start by selecting your favorite tags

**Filtering your feed is probably the most powerful feature of daily.dev**. Since it's all about staying updated with zero effort, making that extra mile to configure your feed would surely pay off. Let's learn how to get it done!

### Click the button at the top of the page to get started!

If this is the first time you use daily.dev, click on the button at the top of the page to get started.

:::caution
The Tags and blocks only affect "MY Feed". They **NOT** affect the other feeds: Popular, Most Upvoted, Best discussions.
:::

This is how your app should look like:

### Choose tags

Once on the Manage tags menu, you're going to have the following options:
1. **Follow a group of tags** (e.g., Backend, Webdev, Data Science, etc.). Click on the "Follow all" button to follow a group of tags, and you're good to go. 
2. **Follow specific tags** within a group. Our team manually curates each group of tags, but you can always select just the tags you're interested in.
3. **Search** for a specific tag. Didn't find the tag you were looking for, use the search to find your key term -> Click the `+` button to follow this tag
