## Start by selecting your favorite tags

**Filtering your feed is probably the most powerful feature of daily.dev**. Since it's all about staying updated with zero effort, making that extra mile to configure your feed would surely pay off. Let's learn how to get it done!

### Navigate to the Manage tags manu

The first step would be to open the sidebar by clicking on the ⚙️ icon -> Choose "Manage tags". 

Once done you should be able to see the following menu:

### Choose tags

Once your on the Manage tags menu you're going to have the following options:
1. **Follow a group of tags** (e.g. Backend, Webdev, Data Science, etc.). To follow a group of tags simply click on the "Follow all" button and you're good to go. 
2. **Follow specific tags** within a group. Each group of tags is manually curated by our team, but you can always select just the tags you're interested in.
3. **Search** for a specific tag. Didn't find the tag you were looking for, simply use the search to find your key term -> Click the `+` button to follow this tag
