# Creating Your Squad

![A cover image for squads](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1690467943/docs/Update%20July%202023/-_Private_squads_v3_2.png)

## What is a Squad?

A Squad is a developer-focused group where members can come together to learn, interact, and engage on topics that matter to them. Think of Squads as tailored online groups specifically for developers. Squads facilitate knowledge sharing, discussions, and peer interactions, making them ideal for teams, projects, communities, or niche interests.

A Squad can be **Public** or **Private**:
- **Public Squads**: Featured in the Squad Directory and open for anyone to join.
- **Private Squads**: Invite-only, ensuring more controlled membership.

## Key Features of Squads

Squads offer several interactive features to create an engaging experience:

✨ **Create a Squad**: Customize your Squad with a unique name, image, and description.

✨ **Invite Members**: Bring in developers you know to discuss, share resources, and collaborate. In Public Squads, adding moderators is recommended to manage conversations effectively.

✨ **Post & Share Content**: Depending on settings, posting can be open to everyone or restricted to moderators. Share daily.dev links, external resources, and support discussions with full markdown compatibility.

✨ **Moderation Tools**: As an admin, you have tools to manage posts, comments, and member interactions, fostering a healthy and respectful environment.

## How to Create a Squad

Starting a Squad is easy. Follow these steps:

1. **Start a New Squad**: In the left sidebar, click the "New Squad" button or find it in the Directory.
2. **Name Your Squad**: Choose a name and handle that captures the focus of your Squad.
3. **Add an Image**: Upload a profile image for your Squad, such as a logo or icon.
4. **Write a Description**: Explain the theme, objectives, and member expectations for your Squad.

## Squad Visibility: Private vs. Public

When creating a Squad, select the desired visibility:

1. **Private Squads**: Accessible only by invite, with content visible only to members.
2. **Public Squads** (default): Open and discoverable in the Directory, allowing developers to join freely.
3. **Featured Squads**: High-value Public Squads with strong engagement may become featured, gaining increased visibility.

Good luck! We can’t wait to see your community thrive ✨
