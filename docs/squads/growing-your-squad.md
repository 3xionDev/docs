2. **Add Content**: Write a post from scratch or share links from the daily.dev feed or external sources. Add a title and description to give context to your members.
3. **Post**: Click "Post" to share your content with the Squad.

## Apply to Become a Public Squad

As your Squad grows and gains activity, you might consider transitioning it to Public status to increase visibility and engagement within the daily.dev community:

1. **Increased Exposure**: Public Squads are featured in the daily.dev feed, reaching a broader audience.
2. **Community Building**: Public status enables you to connect with more developers and expand your community.

For guidance on making your Squad public, including benefits, steps, and tips, refer to our [guide on becoming a Public Squad](/squads/public-squads.md). This guide will provide you with the information you need to successfully transition to Public status.

In the following pages, you’ll learn about tools for moderating your Squad, managing member roles, and adjusting privacy settings.
