# Moderating Your Squad

## Admin, Moderation, and Privacy Settings

As a Squad admin, you have various tools and settings to help manage your Squad effectively. Here’s how to make the most of them.

Note: The tools described here are foundational for Squad management. We’re actively developing advanced moderation options to support even more effective community management.

## Deleting Posts, Comments, and Blocking Users

As an admin, maintaining a respectful community is your responsibility:
* **Deleting Posts or Comments**: To delete a post or comment that violates Squad guidelines, navigate to the post, click on the options menu, and select "Delete." Confirm in the pop-up window.
* **Blocking Users**: For repeated guideline violations, you can block a member. Blocking removes them from the Squad and prevents rejoining. To reverse this action, unblock them manually by locating the user in the member list, choosing "Block" from their options, and confirming.

## Managing Permissions

* **Posting and Inviting**: Control who can post in the Squad and who can invite new members through the "Permissions" section in Squad settings.
* **Group Guidelines**: Create a pinned welcome post outlining the group’s rules and expectations for easy access.

## Member Roles

Squad members can have different roles with distinct permissions:

* **Member**: Can read and write posts, and add comments, as allowed by the permissions set.
* **Moderator**: Has additional permissions to delete posts and comments and manage members following the rules set.
* **Admin**: The admin, typically the Squad creator, can manage all posts, comments, members, and modify Squad settings, including privacy and permissions.

* **Demoting Moderators**: If a moderator is not meeting their responsibilities, you can demote them back to a member by selecting "Demote to Member" in their options menu.
