- **Enhanced productivity:** Focus on your work while staying in the loop with relevant Squad activities.

## How to set up Slack integration

Follow these simple steps to connect your squad with your Slack workspace:

### Step 1: Connect your Slack workspace

1. Navigate to daily.dev and log in to your account.
2. Click on the **"Connect to Slack"** button to initiate the integration.
3. Follow the on-screen prompts to authorize daily.dev to access your Slack workspace.

### Step 2: Connect your Squad to Slack

1. After connecting your Slack workspace, go to the squad you are admin of.
2. Click on the **"Connect to Slack"** button in the squad settings.
3. Choose the Slack channel where you'd like to receive notifications.
4. Confirm your selection to complete the setup.

### Step 3: Start receiving notifications

- Once the integration is complete, you'll start receiving notifications in the selected Slack channel for every new post published in your squad.

## Connecting a Squad to a Private Channel on Slack

If you want to connect your daily.dev squad to a private channel on Slack, follow these steps:

1. **Manually Add the Bot to Your Private Channel:**
   - Go to the private Slack channel where you want to receive squad notifications.
   - Manually add the daily.dev bot/app to the channel. You can do this by typing `/invite @daily.dev` in the channel.

2. **Refresh Your daily.dev Page:**
   - Once the bot is added, return to daily.dev and refresh the page. The private channel should now be visible in the channel selection dropdown.

3. **Connect the Channel:**
   - Select your private Slack channel from the dropdown list in your squad's settings.
   - Complete the connection as usual, and you’ll start receiving notifications in your private channel.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your squad’s updates remain within the privacy of your chosen Slack channel.

If you encounter any issues during the integration process, consider the following:

- Ensure that you have admin rights in both the Slack workspace and the squad.
