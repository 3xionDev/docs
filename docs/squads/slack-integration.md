![Slack integration cover image](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1723031786/docs/Slack_integration.png)

Integrate your Slack workspace with daily.dev Squads to streamline communication and keep your team updated with the latest posts. This guide walks you through connecting your Slack workspace with a Squad, ensuring you never miss important updates.

## Prerequisites

To use the Slack integration, you must be an admin of a Squad or have an existing Squad on daily.dev. If you don't have a Squad yet, we recommend [creating one](/squads/creating-your-squad.md) to fully leverage the Slack integration.

## Benefits of Slack Integration

- **Real-time updates:** Receive instant notifications in your Slack channels whenever new posts are published in your Squad.
- **Seamless collaboration:** Keep your team engaged and informed without switching between platforms.
- **Enhanced productivity:** Focus on work while staying in the loop with relevant Squad activities.

## How to Set Up Slack Integration

Follow these steps to connect your Squad with your Slack workspace:

1. **Go to Your Squad:** Start by navigating to the Squad you want to connect to Slack.

2. **Connect to Slack:** In your Squad's settings, locate the **"Connect to Slack"** button. Click this to begin the integration process.

3. **Authorize and Choose a Channel:** Connect your Slack workspace by authorizing daily.dev. After connecting, select the Slack channel where you’d like to receive notifications.

4. **Start Receiving Notifications:** Once integration is complete, you'll start receiving notifications in the selected Slack channel for every new post published in your Squad.

### Connecting a Squad to a Private Channel on Slack

If you'd like to connect your Squad to a private Slack channel, follow these steps:

1. **Manually Add the Bot to Your Private Channel:**
   - Open the private Slack channel where you want to receive notifications.
   - Manually add the daily.dev bot/app by typing `/invite @daily.dev` in the channel.

2. **Refresh Your daily.dev Page:**
   - After adding the bot, return to daily.dev and refresh the page. The private channel should now be available in the channel selection dropdown.

3. **Connect the Channel:**
   - Select the private Slack channel from the dropdown in your Squad's settings.
   - Complete the connection, and you’ll start receiving notifications in your private channel.

By following these steps, you can ensure that your Squad’s updates remain within your chosen private Slack channel.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues during integration, consider the following:

- Ensure you have admin rights in both the Slack workspace and the Squad.
- Verify the correct Slack channel is selected for receiving notifications.
- Check for any permission issues or authorization requests in Slack.
