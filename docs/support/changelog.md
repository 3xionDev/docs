# Changelog

## Introducing daily.dev algorithm v2.0 ⚡️

Shipping updates to our feed algorithm is always exciting, but today, we're announcing a major release! 🥁

We completely revamped the algorithm, writing it from scratch with all the lessons learned throughout the years of building daily.dev.

**What should you expect? 🤔**

- **High-quality content.** The new algorithm surfaces high-quality content even if it means it needs to look a few days back.

- **Diverse content.** You will see more topics and publications that you haven't seen before on your feed.

- **Updated constantly.** Every few minutes, you will get a new feed tailored for you to enjoy high-quality content throughout the day.
I dunno, my feed looks the same
That makes sense! We're rolling this update gradually, but if you really can't wait, find us on Twitter. 😎

We are excited because the community requested this feature through our GitHub repo ([here's the issue.](https://github.com/dailydotdev/daily/issues/279) And was also contributed by the community! [Here's the PR.](https://github.com/dailydotdev/apps/pull/591) Thank you all for contributing and making this product and community better. 🙏

## Table of contents 🤟

### What's new?

Today we're releasing the first feature in a series of new stuff aiming to make staying up to date more delightful than ever. That is why **we are adding a table of contents for every article.**

### How can it make your life easier?

- **Make smarter choices effortlessly.** Many of you expressed that you want to know what the article is about before reading it. Using the table of contents feature you can get much more context before deciding if you want to read an article.

- **Find exactly what you need.** For the first time, you can navigate to a specific section in an article instead of going through everything directly from daily.dev.

- **Get TLDR for listicles.** Get a TLDR for listicles without having to scroll through the entire article. Lists such as "10 x best practices for y" will now be visible in the table of contents section so you can get the bottom line faster than ever before.

## How can I see the table of contents?

When you're in the feed, to view the table of contents of an article, click on the comment button. It will open the article's page in daily.dev where you can see the table of contents and much more.

## Announcing daily.dev 3.0 🦄

![](https://daily-now-res.cloudinary.com/image/upload/v1635254870/docs/530-e7b211df6c65c9d713bdb192389967c37d85c9e0.png)

Version 3.0 has finally arrived! It's a result of countless hours we spent listening to our community across every possible type of media. So first, we want to send a massive shoutout to everyone who helped us get here! Let's see what's new 👀

### Web App 🤯
We welcome a new fully responsive web app to our product suite of daily.dev! If you still haven't seen it, make sure to check out the [release notes](https://changelog.daily.dev/daily-dev-mobile-friendly-web-app-is-here-195889) and visit our [Product Hunt page.](https://www.producthunt.com/posts/daily-dev-2)

### Unified codebase 👨‍💻
We now have a **unified codebase** for both the [browser extension](https://r.daily.dev/get) and the new mobile-friendly [web app](https://app.daily.dev/)! That means we'll be able to deliver new features faster than ever before.

### Redesign 🎨
The browser extension is getting a serious revamp with a brand new UI. The new design aims to **improve accessibility** and make it easier to use daily.dev on **desktop, tablet, and mobile**.

### Performance 🏎
We're happy to say that daily.dev 3.0 is the fastest version we have ever created! Our team has been working hard to support low-end devices so that everyone worldwide will easily access our feed. That meant making the app 3.4x leaner (1.6x smaller when compressed) and minimizing the amount of information we load. The result is mind-blowing.

### Synced settings 🔗
Now that we support multiple platforms, you can also sync your settings across all of them by simply signing in. If you haven't created an account yet, that's a great opportunity to do so and enjoy a bunch of features available only for registered users like:
- Upvotes
- Filters and feed customizations
- Comments
- Bookmarks

## See you again at 4.0 (or before) 🚀
We have so many good things planned for you! In the coming weeks, we will ship a new set of features and improvements. We plan to focus mostly on:

- Improving content quality
- Easy and simple way to personalize your feed
- More ways to earn reputation and badges

## Need help?
