# Content guidelines

### How do we evaluate new sources for daily.dev?
Submitting a new source to daily.dev is a great way to contribute to our community! We welcome your requests and we promise to give proper attention to each and every request. 

### How does the review process work?
Step 1 - submit a new source using the daily.dev browser extension ([guide](https://dev.to/dailydotdev/how-to-request-for-a-new-source-on-daily-1bie))

Step 2 - after submission of your source, you should get updates by email. In the meantime, our team will review it to decide if it’s suitable for our public directory of sources according to the guidelines below.

Step 3 - if the source is approved, we will publish it on daily.dev to all of the users worldwide. Don’t worry, we will keep you posted via email on the results (usually it takes up to one week). 

Anyway, here are a few guidelines to help you understand the criteria of the review process:

### What we are looking for?

✅ Sources that are generating exciting and professional content.

✅ Sources that publish new content regularly (at least once a week).

✅ Sources that have published a substantial amount of content to date.

✅ Sources about innovative and trending topics that will inspire our community.
