### How we review and select stories ü§ì

The review is simple and straightforward by design. We made it that way to reduce the burden for our contributors yet ensure a high standard for our community. In short, our readers appreciate stories that are: 
- Unique and relevant ideas for developers of all kinds
- Well-written in English
- Not promotional

As long as your story follows the above guidelines, it should pass our review.

Additionally, since [daily.dev/blog](https://daily.dev/blog) is listed in the exclusive source list of the daily.dev browser extension, we are committed to lead by example and to follow our [content guidelines](https://daily.dev/support/content-guidelines) strictly. That means that every single post we publish on our blog must comply with those guidelines as well. 

### Is your post already published somewhere else?

Please note that if your post was already published on your blog or any other magazine it will be automatically rejected. We only accept new and original posts for [daily.dev/blog.](https://daily.dev/blog)

### How to format your draft before submitting it for review üìë

Every draft submitted must use [basic Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/) to write and format the syntax of your story. It is the way for our blog platform to identify how you intended to format your story. In case you‚Äôve written for other blogging platforms, you might already be familiar with Markdown syntax. 

In case Markdown is entirely new to you or if you want to learn about it, [check out this cheat sheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Here-Cheatsheet). Anyway, we‚Äôd be glad to support you in the writing process. In case you couldn‚Äôt find an answer in this Markdown guide, please contact our support. Important Note: Make sure you contact us for Markdown issues only after you‚Äôve already finished writing and polishing your story. 

### What must be included in Google Docs draftüíå

Your article must include:
- Title
- Cover Image. You can make your own or buy one. Otherwise, please pick an image from either: [Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/it-it/), [Pixabay](https://pixabay.com/), or [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com/).
- Link to download the cover image
- Post body in Markdown
- 3-5 relevant tags

### Writer tips and tricks to help you kickstart your writing
There are tons of valuable guides on this topic around the web. However, we wanted to make it easier for you to find the good stuff. We made our collection of tools and articles on [how to write stories for developers that can go viral](https://daily.dev/blog/how-to-write-viral-stories-for-developers). 

### Why writing for software developers makes a difference
There are many reasons why we can fill a whole blog post about it. We don‚Äôt want to overwhelm you with too much content. We just want to emphasize that writing and publishing content is essential for every software developer‚Äôs professional growth. 

We‚Äôve gathered some articles that explain this point well, in our opinion:
- [The Importance of Writing For Software Developers](https://benmccormick.org/2019/03/02/the-importance-of-writing) by Ben McCormick
- [The one skill every Software Developer should master](https://scratchpad.blog/the-one-skill-every-software-developer-should-master/) by Jens Eickmeyer
- [Why developers should know how to write](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/why-developers-should-know-how-to-write-dc35aa9b71ab/) by Derek Mei

### Some legal stuff made simple
Your stories stay yours. We will never claim ownership of them. We simply request a right to use and publish them, once reviewed and selected. At any time, you can cross-promote them wherever you want and at your own free will. In fact, we will be more than happy to see you spreading valuable content for as many developers as possible. It is what daily.dev stands for. One last point to note is that there is no option to change the canonical URL for posts published on our blog.

In other words, stories accepted on daily.dev have and will be shared under a non-exclusive license, where content ownership remains with the contributing writer. daily.dev is granted the right to edit, publish, and distribute the story in any of its publishing platforms.
