Add a verified company badge to your daily.dev profile to showcase your professional affiliation. This badge includes your company's name and logo and is displayed on your public profile and next to your name whenever you post or comment on the platform.

## Prerequisites

To get a verified company badge, you need access to your work email. Make sure you can receive emails at this address, as you’ll need to verify it during the process.

## Benefits of the Verified Company Badge

- Showcase your professional affiliation directly on your profile.
- Build credibility by displaying a verified badge that confirms your employment.
- Stand out in discussions with a badge that appears next to your name whenever you post or comment.

## How to Get Your Verified Company Badge

1. Go to your profile and [navigate to Account Details](https://app.daily.dev/account/profile#verified-company-badge).
2. Scroll down to "Verified Company Badge" and enter your work email.
3. Click "Submit" and check your email for the 6-digit verification code.
4. Enter the 6-digit code on daily.dev. If your company is in our database, your badge will be activated automatically. Otherwise, your request will be reviewed and manually approved by our team.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while verifying your email or getting your badge, consider the following:

- Ensure your work email is correct and check your spam/junk folder if you didn’t receive the verification code.
